bunsen-configs
==============

This package holds configuration files and scripts that are featured
on a Bunsen Labs installation. Some of them have been inherited from
CrunchBang Linux by Philip Newborough.

The main content is:

*) Configuration for a BunsenLabs session at startup, triggered from
a desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions, and allowing the user to run
alternative window managers while keeping the menu, keybinds
and autostarted applications. The default openbox rc.xml and menu.xml
files are left untouched.

*) A collection of user configuration files templates,
stored in /usr/share/bunsen/skel, and a user setup script to
install them, triggered from the Bunsenlabs session.

*) Configuration for lightdm, including a workaround for language selection.

*) Default mimetype configuration.

*) Four new groups added to debian alternatives:
  bl-file-manager
  bl-image-viewer
  bl-media-player
  bl-text-editor
along with corresponding .desktop files and mimeapps.list entries.
These enable users to have more flexibility in their choice of default applications
without having to edit menus, scripts or keyboard shortcuts.

*) Policykit actions allowing pkexec of text editor,
and user shutdown/suspend permissions.

*) Wrapper scripts for mpv, gvim, edit and gdebi-gtk.

*) Firefox default preference for text-box display, to avoid
issues with dark themes.

*) Note: /usr/bin/bl-xdg-autostart was written by Dana Jansens in 2008,
and originally provided in openbox under the GPL-2 licence.

This package also adds some other small system configuration files.

bunsen-configs-lite
===================

This package holds slightly modified user config files, intended to
be appropriate for a system installed from a CD.

At present, the differences from bunsen-configs are:

*) Use Paper icon theme instead of Papirus. This saves some install size
 and also memory use.

*) Use Liberation and Inconsolata fonts instead of Noto.
 This gives a big install size saving at the cost of language support.

*) Do not use a compositor, to save some memory use.

NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
The user config files in skel/ are installed in both packages, but
in bunsen-configs-lite any files in skel-lite/skel/ will overwrite
the equivalent files installed from skel/.
