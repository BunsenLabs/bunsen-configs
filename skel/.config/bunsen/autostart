## BunsenLabs autostart
## ====================
## When you login to your BunsenLabs session, this autostart script
## will be executed to launch any applications
## you want to run at startup.
##
## NB, like openbox's autostart script, this uses the default shell,
## so "bashisms" are not supported.
##
## (Environment variables are set in ~/.config/bunsen/environment.)
##
## Note: some programs, such as 'nm-applet' are run via XDG autostart,
## from .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart.
## To disable this, comment out the last line in this file:
## "bl-xdg-autostart"
##
## Run 'bl-xdg-autostart --list' to list any XDG autostarted programs.
##
## If you do something cool with your autostart script and you think others
## could benefit from your hack, please consider sharing it at:
## http://forums.bunsenlabs.org (registration required)

## WINDOW MANAGER
## Do not edit the next line unless you have also installed any
## necessary other programs for the different window manager,
## and edited the window-manager-dependent section later in this file.
## Use the window manager's actual command, not name:
window_manager=openbox

# test if chosen window manager is actually running (you should probably not edit this line)
pgrep -x -u "$USER" "$window_manager" || { echo "$0: Window manager $window_manager is not running." >&2 ; exit 1;}

### SETTINGS START

# start keybinds daemon
# (If this clashes with some window manager's keybinds,
# you can move it to the window-manager-dependent section below.)
xbindkeys_autostart

## Turn on/off system beep.
xset b off

## Set keyboard settings - 250 ms delay and 25 cps (characters per second) repeat rate.
## Adjust the values according to your preferances.
xset r rate 250 25

## Add keyboard mapping.
#xmodmap -e "keysym Insert = Multi_key"

## Disable CapsLock
#setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
# alternative: use as compose key
#setxkbmap -option compose:caps

### TOUCHPAD: comment out the next two entries if you don't have one

## Configure touchpad. See 'man synaptics' for more info.
## (Now might be using libinput instead of synaptics.)
synclient VertEdgeScroll=1 HorizEdgeScroll=1 TapButton1=1 2>/dev/null

## Disable touchpad while typing
syndaemon -i .5 -K -t -R -d &
